## What is this?

This package wraps [`unified-engine`][unified-engine] so that it can be used
to create a Gulp plugin.
Itâ€™s what you use underneath when you use [`gulp-remark`][gulp-remark].

## When should I use this?

You can use this to let users process files from a gulp plugin, letting them
configure from the file system.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-engine-gulp
```

## Use

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import {engineGulp} from 'unified-engine-gulp'

export const gulpRemark = engineGulp({
  ignoreName: '.remarkignore',
  name: 'gulp-remark',
  packageField: 'remarkConfig',
  pluginPrefix: 'remark',
  processor: remark,
  rcName: '.remarkrc'
})
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`engineGulp`][api-engine-gulp].
There is no default export.

### `engineGulp(options)`

Create a [Gulp][] plugin.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: see [writing a Gulp plugin][plugin] for more info.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], required])
    â€” configuration

###### Returns

Gulp plugin, which can be called with options (same as [`Options`][api-options]
but w/o `name` or `processor`) and returns a [`through2`][through2] stream
accepting Vinyl files ([`FileStream`][api-file-stream]).

### `FileStream`

File stream (TypeScript type).

Streaming vinyl files are not supported.
Read more about why in [Gulpâ€™s docs (point 10)][streaming].

Thereâ€™s also a `fileStream.use()` function, which is like
[`unified.use()`][use], in that it accepts a plugin and configuration or a
preset.
It returns the operated on `fileStream`.

###### Type

```ts
import type {Transform} from 'node:stream'

type FileStream = Transform & {use: Use}

type Use = (...values: unknown[]) => FileStream
```

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Type

```ts
import type {EngineOptions} from 'unified-engine'

type Options = {name: string} & Omit<
  EngineOptions,
  | 'alwaysStringify'
  | 'cwd'
  | 'extensions'
  | 'files'
  | 'out'
  | 'output'
  | 'plugins'
  | 'silentlyIgnore'
  | 'streamIn'
  | 'streamOut'
>
```

## Debugging

The engine can be debugged by setting the [`DEBUG`][debug] environment variable
to `*`, such as `DEBUG="*" gulp â€¦`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`FileStream`][api-file-stream] and
[`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `unified-engine-gulp@^10`,
compatible with Node.js 12.

## Security

`unified-engine-gulp` loads and evaluates configuration files, plugins, and
presets from the file system (often from `node_modules/`).
That means code that is on your file system runs.
Make sure you trust the workspace where you run `unified-engine-gulp` and be
careful with packages from npm and changes made by contributors.
